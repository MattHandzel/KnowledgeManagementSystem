# Terminal Capture Daemon – Web App

A minimalistic React + TypeScript + Tailwind web app that presents the system’s features, architecture, and documentation links. Informational-only; no daemon integration yet.

## Prerequisites

## Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build and Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- Content paths include `index.html` and `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`.
- The app links to repository docs (README, DESIGN_SPECIFICATION, and docs/REPO_READTHROUGH.md).
